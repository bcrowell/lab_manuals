\introduction
When an electric stove uses up electrical energy to heat a pan of water, the water gains energy
in the form of random kinetic energy of its molecules. This energy gain is referred to as
\emph{heat}, and is measured in units of joules. Heating is different from mechanical transfers
of energy such as throwing a baseball, which occur through a macroscopic force. Heating occurs
in chemical reactions, in conduction of heat from a hot object to a cooler one, and in phase changes
such as melting or condensation.

Different substances are not all equally easy to heat.
When an object's temperature changes by $\Delta T$, the heat can be calculated as
\begin{equation*}
  Q = m c \Delta T,
\end{equation*}
where $m$ is the mass of material and $c$, known as the specific heat capacity, is often approximately constant. The units of the specific
heat capacity are 
$\junit /\kgunit \degunit\zu{C}$ in the SI, or $\zu{cal}/\gunit \degunit\zu{C}$.

If an object undergoes a phase change, the quantity of heat is given by
\begin{equation*}
  Q = L m,
\end{equation*}
where $m$ is the mass of the material and $L$ is called latent heat.
That is, latent heat is the amount of energy required for a phase transition
per unit mass. In a change of state between solid and liquid, i.e., melting or freezing,
$L$ is referred to as the latent heat of fusion. The units of
latent heat are $\junit /\kgunit$ in the SI, or $\zu{cal}/\gunit $.


In this lab, we will build a calorimeter and determine the specific
heat capacity of aluminum and latent heat of fusion of water. Ideally,
a calorimeter is thermally isolated. Since the energy of the system is
conserved, the total heat transfer inside of a calorimeter is then zero
\begin{equation*}
\sum_i^N Q_i = 0.
\end{equation*}

\observations 

\labpart{Preparation}
Any insulated container can be used as a calorimeter. In the picture
above, a calorimeter is made of styrofoam cups.  However, you can
build a calorimeter out of any appropriate material. Here are some tips for making a
calorimeter.

\begin{itemize}
\item The material should be a good thermal insulator.
\item You need to seal the calorimeter well to minimize heat leaks. 
\item You need to come up with a way to measure the inside temperature while minimizing leakage of heat.
In the picture below, this has been done by inserting the thermometer through a small hole in the cup.
\end{itemize}

\labpart{Specific heat of aluminum}
Prepare room temperature water and put it in the calorimeter. Then, place 50 g aluminum pellets inside of a heating cup. Put the cup in hot water to raise the temperature of the aluminum to be higher than 70 $^\circ$C. \textit{While heating the cup, keep the aluminum dry.} If the aluminum pellets are wet, the result will be altered by the hot water droplets. 

Once the aluminum pellets are ready, quickly, dump the pellets to the calorimeter and seal the container. Measure and record the final temperature when the system reaches equilibrium. 

CAUTION: When you hold a hot heating cup, wear an oven mitt. Be careful with hot boiling water. 

\labpart{Latent heat of fusion}
Prepare warm water (about 40 $^\circ$C) and an ice cube. Measure the mass and temperature of the water and ice. Put the water and ice cube in the calorimeter and measure the equilibrium temperature after the ice is completely melted.  

\subsection*{Additional note}
You need to know the initial temperature of the ice cube you use. Think about a method to measure the temperature. Alternatively, you can also set the initial temperature of an ice cube to a particular value instead.  


\analysis
When you do the calculations, assume the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. 
\subsection*{Specific heat calculation}
From the measurements, determine the specific heat capacity of aluminum.
\subsection*{Latent heat Calculation}
From the measurements, determine the latent heat of fusion of water. 
\subsection*{Error analysis}
Calculate errors in the specific heat and latent heat by propagating errors from the raw data. Compare your result with the correct values. Then write down your conclusion in the lab report. 


\prelab

\prelabquestion 200 g of water initially at 10 $^\circ$ C is inside of a calorimeter. You pour 100 g of water at 50 $^\circ$ C into the calorimeter. What is the equilibrium temperature? We assume the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible.
