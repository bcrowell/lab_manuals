\lab{The dipole and superposition}\label{lab:dipole-and-superposition}

\section*{About this lab}

\covid\ 
It is intended to be used during the sixth week in Physics 222.
It is a modified version of Minilab 5 from \emph{Fields and Circuits}.

\apparatus
\equip{banana plug cables (4, soldered by the student)}
\equip{piece of thread (not in kit)}
\equip{solenoid (made by the student from about 10 m of 22 gauge wire)}
\equip{ferrite disk magnet}
\equip{1.5 V battery and holder (optionally two of these)}
\equip{multimeter (optional)}
\equip{two 10-ohm resistors (brown-black-red-gold color code)}
\equip{alligator clips (6)}
\equip{timing device (stopwatch, computer, or cell phone app)}

\section*{Preparation}
You will need to have made at least four banana plug cables, using the method shown in the video that describes that.
You will also need to build a solenoid like the one shown in the introductory video for this lab. This is the main
purpose of the thin 22-gauge wire provided in the kit. I made mine out of 54 turns of wire wrapped around a two-inch part of
a Starbucks cup, as shown in the video.

\section*{Theory}

Although this lab uses magnetic fields, you do not actually have to know very much at all about magnetic fields except for
the following facts: (1) the magnetic field acts like a vector; (2) magnetic fields from different sources \emph{superpose}, i.e.,
they add like vectors at any given point in space; (3) the magnetic field made by an electromagnet is proportional to the electric
current passing through it, meaning a measure of the amount of charge per unit time that flows past a certain point.
Facts 1 and 2 are the same as for electric or gravitational fields, so in this sense the lab is really more like a lab about
fields in general.

The lab also uses a simple electric circuit, but you don't need to know much about circuits to do the lab.
The circuit contains a battery, which provides a voltage of 1.5 V. You can think of the battery as a pump, and the
voltage as a measure of how much pressure the pump provides. When the circuit is hooked up to form a complete loop,
a current flows, which is measured in amperes, A. An ampere is one coulomb per second of charge. If we hooked up
the battery directly to the magnet, a large amount of current would flow. This would rapidly kill the battery, and
would also release a lot of heat. To keep this from happening, we will add a resistor to your circuit. The smallest
value supplied in the assortment of resistors we got from our supplier was 10 ohms, which worked reasonably well for me.
The battery, solenoid, and resistor go in a series circuit, meaning that they form a single loop, like a necklace.
To turn off the circuit, you can break it at any point so that it no longer forms a complete loop. It's a good idea
not to leave it on all the time, because the resistor can get hot.

As demonstrated in the video, you will hang the ferrite disk magnet from a thread, with its axis in a horizontal plane
and coinciding with the axis of the solenoid. The magnet then has some period of oscillation $T$ as it twists.
The oscillation of the magnet is simple harmonic motion, so the period and
the magnetic field $B$ supplied by the solenoid are related by $T\propto B^{-1/2}$.
If superposition holds, then varying the current by some factor should change $B$ by the same factor, and therefore
$T$ should change by one over the square root of that factor.

An added complication is that there will be an ambient magnetic field, which consists of the earth's magnetic field
plus whatever field exists because of the building materials in the building you're in. For my setup, I found that
the field of the magnet was actually similar in size to the earth's field. To make it easy to take this into account,
you should align your solenoid and your disk magnet's axes with the earth's field. If you turn off the solenoid, this should
happen naturally as the disk magnet acts like a compass. You can then position the solenoid with its axis along the same line.
By doing this, you make the two magnetic field vectors lie along the same line, so that vector addition is just like addition of
real numbers, taking into account plus and minus signs for direction.


\observations

We are not providing you with a variable power supply, the issue arises of how to vary the current.
The simplest thing you can do is to create three different fields in the following way: (1) solenoid turned off;
(2) solenoid on and reinforcing the earth's field; and (3) solenoid on and opposing the earth's field.
If you do this, then you get currents $-I_0$, 0, and $I_0$. Then in its simplest incarnation,
the lab can be analyzed by graphing $\pm T^{-2}$ against the current, arbitrarily taking $I_0$ to be 1 unit. You can then test theory, which
predicts that this graph should be a line (with the x intercept being the current required in order to
cancel the earth's field).

The video demonstrates some optional, fancier things you can try.

If you include the meter, then you can measure
the current directly. This would let you know, for example, if the currents $\pm I_0$ were not quite the same
because of small changes in the resistance of the alligator clip connections when you make and break those connections.

You can double the current either by putting two resistors in parallel (as shown in the video) or by
using a second battery (if you have one handy, and some way to rig up connections). 
If you do this, then you can get currents $-2I_0$, $-I_0$, 0, $I_0$, and $2I_0$.
Watch out because
quite a bit of heat will be generated in the double-current setup, as demonstrated in the video when I
burn my fingers. Turn the circuit on only for as long as necessary to get a measurement of the period,
and then turn it off and let the resistor cool off.
