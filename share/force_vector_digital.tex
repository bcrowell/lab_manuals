\introduction

Modern physics claims that when a bridge, an earthquake
fault, or an oak tree doesn't move, it is because the forces
acting on it, which combine according to vector addition,
add up to zero.  Although this may seem like a reasonable
statement, it was far from obvious to premodern scientists. 
Aristotle, for instance, said that it was the nature of each
of the four elements, earth, fire, water and air, to return
to its natural location.  Rain would fall from the sky
because it was trying to return to its natural location in
the lakes and oceans, and once it got to its natural
location it would stop moving because that was its nature.

When a modern scientist considers a book resting on a table,
she says that it holds still because the force of gravity
pulling the book down is exactly canceled by the normal
force of the table pushing up on the book.  Aristotle would
have denied that this was possible, because he believed that
at any one moment an object could have only one of two
mutually exclusive types of motion: natural motion (the
tendency of the book to fall to the ground, and resume its
natural place), and forced motion (the ability of another
object, such as the table, to move the book).  According to
his theory, there could be nothing like the addition of
forces, because the object being acted on was only capable
of ``following orders''  from one source at a time.  The
incorrect Aristotelian point of view has great intuitive
appeal, and beginning physics students tend to make
Aristotelian statements such as, ``The table's force
overcomes the force of gravity,'' as if the forces were
having a contest, in which the victor annihilated the loser.

\observations

The apparatus consists of 
four taut strings, each pulling in a different direction
in the horizontal plane. Each string is connected to a force sensor
that can be read out on a computer, giving the magnitude of the
force vector.


Set the force sensors on their 10 N scales using the switch on each
sensor.
Plug the sensors into channels 1 through 4 on the LabPro interface, and connect the
interface to the USB port of the Windows machine.
From the Start menu, go to All Programs, Vernier Software, Logger Pro 3.8.
When you start up the software, it will automatically detect
the four sensors and start displaying their readings. 


Possible computer hassles:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Normally the computer automatically detects the sensor and sets itself up
properly. If this doesn't happen, you need to do the setup manually under
Experiment:Set up sensors:Show all interfaces.
\item[] If the readings are displayed in a small font, you can make them bigger
by clicking on the surrounding box and using the little black tabs to resize it.
\end{itemize}

Push and pull on the sensors, and verify that they can measure forces.
What do you notice about the signs of the forces?
You will notice that when you don't apply any force to a sensor, its reading
is small, but not exactly zero.
With the sensors placed horizontally, use the software's blue $\emptyset$ button to zero them all, so that
this systematic error is eliminated. If you now rotate a sensor so that its hook
is pointing down, you should see that the force reading changes by a certain amount,
which is the weight of the hook, about $0.21$ N.

Try pushing gently sideways on the force sensor. You will see that it doesn't
sense the force.
Each sensor can only measure the component of the force along its
own axis.

After taking real data, you'll do a complete calibration of the
sensors. They drift over time, so a calibration done right now wouldn't be useful.
However, sometimes we have sensors that are off by a very large
amount such as 50\%, and in that case it's better to find out about that now, because
it will make it look like your data don't even make sense. As a quick check, try
pairs of sensors hooked together and pulling against each other, and make sure that
they seem to at least approximately obey Newton's third law.

Cut off a piece of butcher paper. Tie strings to the sensors in the arrangement shown in the diagram.
After some trial and error, I've found the following technique to minimize the
pain of tying the strings. Let the sensors be 1, 2, 3, and 4, in order around the
circle, as in the figure. The idea is to connect 1 and 2 with a string, and also
3 and 4, with the 1-2 string and 3-4 string wrapping around each other at an intersection-point at the 
center.\footnote{Because of friction at the intersection, the four tensions can all be different.
If the strings
were frictionless, we would be guaranteed to have $T_1=T_2$ and $T_3=T_4$ with this arrangement, and
that probably wouldn't allow us to get the right forces for equilibrium.}
At each of the hooks, tie an overhand knot on a bight; this knot is easy
to tie and throw over a hook, and will not slip.

To keep the sensors in place and apply tension to the strings, stick a pencil or a skinny
pen into the hole in each one, and grip the pencil. This allows the sensor to naturally swing
into position so that its axis is parallel to the string. Holding the sensors' housings in your
hands doesn't work, because it results in a misalignment.

Avoid a symmetric arrangement of
the strings (e.g., don't space them all 90 degrees apart), and
don't make any forces collinear with each other. 

\fig{me-vec-knots}

The angles are the main source of random error. Once you have a setup that's adjusted
approximately the way you want, you can draw lines on the paper
with a ruler, then carefully locate the strings above the lines. The angles of the lines on
the paper are easy to measure accurately.

Try to get the forces to be roughly 3 to 7 N.
Although the sensors are labeled ``10 N,'' some of them actually max out at 9 or 9.5 N.
The sensors will not give any
error or warning if this limit is exceeded. They will simply max out at some
reading, and this reading will be incorrect. When increasing the tension in a string, keep an eye
on the reading on the screen; if it stops increasing, you've exceeded that sensor's limit.
Once you think you have a good equilibrium, check that when you increase the tension a little, the
reading actually goes up.

Before taking your final data, temporarily relax the tension on the strings and redo the zeroing of the
sensors, which we have found will drift over time.

Take all the data you will need in order to carry out the vector addition of the four forces.
To decrease the random errors in the force measurements, you can tell the software to average
the data over a period of time. Click on the Collect button to make a graph.
Then highlight part of the graph, and go to Analyze:Statistics.

As a cross-check in case confusion arises later about how your angles were defined, which
force was which, etc., write down on the butcher paper which sensor was which.
Also, 
mark the sensors 1, 2, 3, and 4 with masking tape.

The sensors differ from each other quite a bit in their
calibration, with four freshly zeroed sensors giving readings
that covered a range of about 5\% when used to measure a 500 g weight.
To eliminate this error, set up the 30-cm steel bar
horizontally and mount all four sensors on it vertically, with their hooks pointing down.
Zero the sensors again so that the weights of the hooks are tared out.
Hang the 500 g weight from each sensor, and use these readings to
rescale each sensor's reading from the vector addition setup by the proper amount.

\selfcheck

Do a preliminary rough analysis of your results using graphical addition.

\prelab

\prelabquestion  Describe a typical scale that you might use for drawing
force vectors on a piece of paper, e.g., how long might you
choose to make a 1-N force?  Assume that your forces are
from 5 to 10 newtons, and pick a scale that results in a drawing that
is as big as it can be (for maximum precision) while still fitting on
a piece of paper.

\prelabquestion Thinking ahead to your analytic addition of the forces,
which of the following would be the most convenient form in which to have
your angle measurements? --- (1) the angles of the four ``pie slices,''
(2) the angle of each string measured clockwise around the table,
or (3) the angle of each string measured counterclockwise around the table.

\analysis

Calculate the magnitude of vector sum of the forces on the
ring both graphically and analytically, using the corrected data. Use the
graphical result to check that the analytic calculations were correct.

Propagation of error for this lab could in principle be very time-consuming,
since you would have to redo the vector addition eight times for the eight
pieces of raw data (four angles and four magnitudes). 
To avoid this, take the following shortcuts: (1) Whichever is larger,
$F_{total,x}$ or $F_{total,y}$, just do error analysis on that component.
(2) The random errors in the result are dominated by the errors in the angles,
so don't bother propagating the error from the magnitudes.

Are your results consistent with theory, taking into account
the random errors involved? Perform a statistical test like the
one in the example on p.~\pageref{eg:fine-structure} (``How significant?'').
